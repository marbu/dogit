# Dogit TODO list

proposed features:

 * access rights should be preserved (see dfm how it doest this)
 * workflow issues (missing files ...)
 * better workflow description, maybe even create proper docs
 * compatibility with python 2.4 (really? :)

## Known problems

### Remote is not there: missing fetch config

See `dotfiles.git/config`:

~~~
[remote "origin"]
    url = git@github.com:marbu/dotfiles.git
~~~

There is no fetch option, quickfix:

 * add `fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*`
 * git fetch origin

TODO: prevent this from happening

### Lost access rights

Unfortunatelly git doesn't store unix access rights but exec flag, so when
config file is sensitive to it's access rigths like `~/.ssh/config`, we have
a problem. Moreover broken ssh conig means we are not able to push/pull in
most cases.

Quickfix: do `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/conig` after each branch checkout

TODO: add this into git hook in same way, should be conigurable via dotfiles
config file

### Changing branches

When one change branch from local one to master, some configuration may
dissapear or become broken (eg. missing `~/.ssh/config`). Which may create
issues, especially when such broken coniguration affects ssh. Again, no
push/pull then.

TODO: propose new workflow

## Proposed workflows and other ideas

### Branching when no upstream push is done

When the master is read only (I'm not going to push anything upstream), then
the local master branch is not needed, I can just do:

~~~
dogit fetch origin
dogit rebase -i origin/master
~~~

without the need to checkout local master branch.

Nevertheless when I need to push upstream, I can do it this way:

~~~
dogit fetch origin
dogit graph # to check if origin/master dissapears =>do merge
dogit checkout master
dogit merge origin/master # if needed, no conflicts possible
dogit cherry-pick 123f21d
dogit checkout -
dogit rebase -i master
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config # this is another issue which needs to be addressed
dogit push origin master
~~~

### Branching when pushing into master

Create a new upstream working tree with master - but with the same git repo!
so that:

 * you can directly cherry pick a commit from there
 * you don't have to switch branches in homedir (conig problems)
 * you can inspect what's there (in the master)
 * in master, there can be a README file (deleted on local branches)

### Example of switching branches

different coniguration for python (vim,lint)


## Interesting features of git

Following notes may be handy later.

### Git hooks

TODO see if usefull for fixing wrong access rights or missing ssh config

### Checkout a branch, rebase and merge to master

~~~
# on branch "master":
$ git checkout feature && git rebase @{-1} && git checkout @{-2} && git merge @{-1}
# rebases "feature" to "master" and merges it in to master
~~~

The special `@{-n}` syntax means "n-th branch checked out before current one".
When we checkout "feature", `@{-1}` is a reference to `master`. After rebasing,
we need to use `@{-2}` to checkout master because `@{-1}` is a reference to the
same branch (`feature`) due to how rebasing works internally.

Update: Bj√∂rn Steinbrink points out that this can be done in just 2 commands:

~~~
$ git rebase HEAD feature && git rebase HEAD @{-2}
~~~

or do it with master checkout out somewhere else - just in case
(like git new-workdir)
